-------
FastAPI application entrypoint for Snipe-IT Lite.

This file's ONLY job is: create the FastAPI app, configure CORS, customize
the OpenAPI schema, run startup (init_db/seed_db), and mount every
`APIRouter` from `api/`. All request/response schemas live in `schemas/`,
all business/CRUD logic lives in `services/`, and the shared auth
dependencies (`get_current_user`, `require_super_admin`,
`require_privileged_role`) live in `deps.py`. Nothing in this file talks to
the database directly.

Authentication model:
  - POST /auth/login checks the email/password against the `users` table and,
    on success, returns a signed JWT that encodes the user's id/name/email/
    role/department.
  - Every other protected route requires that JWT in the `Authorization:
    Bearer <token>` header. `deps.get_current_user` decodes it to learn who
    is calling and what they're allowed to do.

Role model:
  - "super_admin" -> full access to everything. NOT a database row -- this
                     is a single hardcoded root identity configured via the
                     SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME/SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment
                     variables (see config.py and security.py's
                     super_admin_principal()). Exactly one exists, always;
                     it can never be created, edited, or deleted through
                     the app, and it never appears in the User Directory or
                     any other listing (see deps.py + services/auth_service.py
                     + services/user_service.py for where this is enforced).
  - "admin"       -> a normal, database-backed account with every privilege
                     "super_admin" has (see deps.py's _FULL_ADMIN_ROLES) --
                     the difference is purely how the account exists
                     (editable/deletable `users` row vs. the one hardcoded
                     identity above), never what it's allowed to do.
  - "manager"     -> can view inventory, dispatch/check-in items to ANY of
                     the three channels (Staff, Linked Customers, or Ad-Hoc
                     Individuals), and view + manage custody for users in
                     their own department. Can ALSO provision new Staff and
                     Customer login accounts (see POST /users), but can
                     never provision another Manager or Admin account.
                     Still cannot create/delete asset pools, cannot adjust
                     pool capacity, and cannot flag maintenance exceptions --
                     those remain Super Admin/Admin-only.
  - "staff"       -> a regular employee record. Has a read-only self-service
                     dashboard (staff.html) showing only their own custody.
  - "customer"    -> an external contact with a login. Has a read-only
                     self-service dashboard (customer.html), same idea as
                     staff but for people outside the company.

# MIDDLEWARE STACK
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Starlette/FastAPI executes middleware in the REVERSE of the order they're
# added here -- the LAST one added ends up as the OUTERMOST layer, seeing
# every request first and every response last. We rely on that to get this
# execution order (outermost -> innermost):
#
#   SecurityHeadersMiddleware   (added last -> outermost: stamps headers
#                                onto literally every response, including
#                                CORS preflights and 429s from below)
#   CORSMiddleware              (must wrap RateLimitMiddleware so a
#                                browser-blocked/rate-limited response still
#                                carries correct CORS headers and isn't
#                                reported to the frontend as a confusing
#                                opaque network error)
#   RequestContextMiddleware    (assigns the request's correlation ID as
#                                early as possible, so even a request that
#                                gets rate-limited below still logs with a
#                                proper request_id and returns X-Request-ID)
#   RateLimitMiddleware         (added first -> innermost: only cares about
#                                POST /auth/login; every other path is a
