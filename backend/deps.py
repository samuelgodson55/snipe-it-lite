-------
Shared FastAPI dependencies used across every router in `api/`: decoding and
validating the bearer JWT (`get_current_user`), and the two role gates
(`require_super_admin`, `require_privileged_role`) built on top of it.

Kept as one small standalone module (rather than living inside main.py or
any single router) specifically so every `api/*.py` file can import from
here without creating a dependency on main.py itself.
