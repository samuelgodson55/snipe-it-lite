# frontend (js/components/audit.js) does TRUE server-side paging against
# it -- fetching one page at a time from the API on every "Next"/"rows per
# page" change -- rather than loading the whole table into the browser like
# the other (much smaller, bounded) directories do. See

# maintenance note, etc. (see services/asset_service.py,
# services/user_service.py). See services/export_service.py's
# `csv_safe_cell()` docstring for the full threat model/mitigation -- this
# module reuses that same shared helper (rather than keeping its own copy)
# so every exporter in the app is protected identically.

    on the Celery `worker` container (see api/audit.py's module docstring

    stream into. It stays a generator (rather than building one big string
    up front) anyway, since that's still the cheaper way to assemble it row
    by row regardless of what ultimately consumes it.
