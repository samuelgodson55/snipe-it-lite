    Powers GET /checkouts/overdue (Operations & Observability requirement
    #5) -- the data behind a "Dashboard Alerts" banner on admin.html /
    manager.html that flags active checkouts whose `due_date` has already
    passed, so Super Admins/Managers notice overdue equipment without
    having to hunt for it inside every asset pool's Properties Hub one by
    one.

    "Overdue" here means: status == "active" (not yet returned) AND
    due_date is not null AND due_date is strictly in the past compared to
    right now (`models.utc_now()`). A checkout with no due_date at all is
    intentionally never considered overdue -- it was checked out
    open-ended on purpose (see AdvancedCheckoutRequest.due_date being
    Optional).

    SCOPING: Super Admins see every overdue checkout system-wide. Managers
    only see overdue checkouts belonging to users in their OWN department,
    plus any overdue Outsider/ad-hoc checkouts they themselves dispatched
    -- mirroring the same department-scoping rule already used by
    list_users()/get_audit_logs() elsewhere in this codebase, so a Manager
    can't see another department's overdue equipment.
