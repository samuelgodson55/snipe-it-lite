api/audit.py
------------
GET /audit-logs, plus the async export job trio:
  POST /audit-logs/export                    -- enqueue a CSV/PDF export job
  GET  /audit-logs/export/{task_id}/status   -- poll a job's progress
  GET  /audit-logs/export/{task_id}/download -- fetch the finished file

WHY ASYNC?
----------
The audit ledger is the one dataset in this app guaranteed to grow without
bound (see services/audit_service.py's module docstring) -- a Super Admin
exporting a wide date range as a PDF could take long enough to generate
that it isn't safe to build inline in a single request/response cycle
(it would tie up an API worker process, and risks the browser/proxy
timing the request out before the file is ready). Generation now happens
out-of-band on a separate `worker` container running Celery (see
celery_app.py and tasks/export_tasks.py) -- this router's job is just to
enqueue that work and let the frontend poll for it, never to build the
file itself.
